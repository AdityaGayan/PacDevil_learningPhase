## Run the project

To view the final game run the following command in terminal
```bash
npm run dev
```
And then go to [Link Text](http://localhost:3000/)

Note:
1) Character is at the bottom left of the game screen(at first it might be difficult to view because color of ground and character is same)
2) the main typescript file game.ts is in src directory
